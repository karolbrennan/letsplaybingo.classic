# Let's Play Bingo - Classic [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c5306ef6-ffe8-445d-b74c-64a897abff28/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lpbclassic/deploys)

This is a very simple bingo caller - it generates random bingo numbers, keeps track of them on a live bingo board.
If voice synthesis is supported by the browser the balls will be called aloud using the web speech synthesis api.
This is the first ReactJS version of Let's Play Bingo written before the late April 2020 redesign.
